This is kind of like a ascii graphics engine I made. You can draw some shapes using code and have them be displayed on screen. The shapes are reactangles, horizontal lines, and vertical lines. There's no general drawLine function because that would involve diagnol lines which are harder to code than horizontal and vertical lines. I tried making diagnol line drawing with trigonometry, but messed up, one of the reasons likely being how the y axis basically goes down rather than up. Maybe I'll make another ascii graphics engine with even more shapes to draw.
